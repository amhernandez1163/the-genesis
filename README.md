Prior to the start of the UTSA Coding Bootcamp, we, the students, we were assigned a Pre-Work module. In this module were basic tasks such as: create a profile for GitHub, install VS Code, etc. There was one sub-module within Pre-Work with one dedicated page titled "HTML Basics". I had no prior knowledge, so this was my first introduction to HTML - nevermind CSS! After reading the HMTL Basics, we were given our first assignment: "Activity: My Favorite Musician". 

And alas (with the help of many google searches), "Activity: My Favorite Musician" was the genesis! My very first "website". I've grown a lot since this assignment, but it's nice to see where it all started. 

I created this GitHub repo for the-genesis retroactively - now that i know somewhat of what I'm doing. Enjoy!
